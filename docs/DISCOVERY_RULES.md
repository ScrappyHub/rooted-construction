# ROOTED Construction – Discovery Rules

## Authority

ROOTED Construction discovery is bound to the global ROOTED GEO law defined in:

rooted-core/docs/GEO_RULES.md

These rules CANNOT be overridden at the construction vertical level.

---

## Construction Discovery Behavior

All contractor, subcontractor, and specialist discovery MUST obey:

- ✅ 50-mile maximum radius
- ✅ 6–8 result limit per discovery row
- ✅ Fair rotation across sessions
- ✅ Local-only visibility by default

This applies to:
- General contractor discovery
- Specialty contractor discovery
- Emergency contractor discovery
- Municipal contractor sourcing
- Insurance repair sourcing

---

## Specialty Filtering

When users filter by:

- Roofing
- Electrical
- Plumbing
- Concrete
- Structural
- Fire Systems
- HVAC
- Emergency Services

The system MUST:
- Keep the 6–8 result rule
- Keep the 50-mile boundary
- Only change the specialty filter
- Never expand globally

## Enforcement

If this file ever conflicts with:

rooted-core/docs/GEO_RULES.md

The CORE rule always wins.
